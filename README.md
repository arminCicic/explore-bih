**WORK IN PROGRESS**



App will showcase the most interesting and exciting places to visit in Bosnia and Herzegovina for tourists. The goal of this app is to provide a convenient and user-friendly way for visitors to discover the beauty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Built with Angular framework, I focused on showcase of simple angular features and full app responsiveness using custom CSS. 

Currently working on front-end of the application. After adding back-end, app will handle user authentication, data storage and have complete search mechanism.
